<font color="#00ffff">Game Speed Modes

</font><font color="#ffffff">FrogComposband offers several different game-speed modes, depending on 
how long and complex you wish the game to be. </font><font color="#ff0000">Normal mode </font><font color="#ffffff">is the full 
FrogComposband experience; it gives access to a vast wilderness, and 
many towns, dungeons and side-quests not available in other modes. But 
if you want to play a shorter game, or are just getting started and 
don't want too many complications, there are two accelerated game modes 
available: the very fast </font><font color="#ff0000">coffee-break mode</font><font color="#ffffff">, and the ultra-fast 
</font><font color="#ff0000">instant-coffee mode</font><font color="#ffffff">.

Your ultimate goals remain the same regardless of mode: kill the 
</font><font color="#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</font><font color="#ffffff">, and before that, kill </font><font color="#ff0000">Oberon </font><font color="#ffffff">to gain access to the 
Serpent's lair. But what else you can expect to do, and how quickly you 
will reach the endgame, depends greatly on the game speed selected.

<a name="Normal"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Normal (full game)

</font><font color="#ffffff">This is the traditional game speed, and the one that offers the most 
complete game. In a full game of FrogComposband, you will fight 
thousands of monsters, complete dozens of quests, explore more than 30 
dungeons and eagerly inspect thousands of (potentially) magical 
objects. It is possible to play in Normal Mode with the special 
coffee-break town and no wilderness, but this is strongly not 
recommended.

A complete game in normal-speed mode typically lasts between 15 and 150 
hours. The speedrun record for a full-game win is 4 hours and 6 
minutes.

<a name="Coffee-Break"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Coffee-Break Mode (fast)

</font><font color="#c08040">Coffee-break mode </font><font color="#ffffff">offers an accelerated game, with fewer quests, only 
one dungeon (Angband), one town (a special version of Outpost) and no 
wilderness. Every level you explore will be deeper than the one before; 
the only staircases are downshafts that take you down two levels at a 
time. You are allowed to return to the town by Word of Recall.

Experience gain from killing monsters in the dungeon is much faster in 
coffee-break mode (experience gain outside the dungeon is not 
accelerated). The quality and quantity of monster item drops are also 
both increased; and most forms of proficiency gain are accelerated. In 
coffee-break mode, you get stronger faster, but also start running into 
dangerous monsters more rapidly.

Coffee-break mode uses a special level-size generation algorithm; in 
general, levels tend to be very small in the early game and become 
larger as the endgame approaches.

Selecting </font><font color="#ff0000">Beginner Mode </font><font color="#ffffff">automatically turns coffee-break mode on, but 
it is not necessarily easier than normal mode and not intended 
exclusively for new players.

A complete game in coffee-break mode typically lasts between 5 and 50 
hours.

<a name="InstantCoffee"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Instant-Coffee Mode (ultra-fast)

</font><font color="#c08040">Instant-coffee mode </font><font color="#ffffff">is a super-accelerated game. It resembles 
coffee-break mode, but is even more streamlined; dungeon levels with no 
quests are skipped completely (effectively leaving only 13 levels in 
the dungeon), the number of town quests is greatly reduced, experience 
gain is accelerated even further (including outside the dungeon), and 
loot quality is boosted even more than in coffee-break mode.

A special feature of instant-coffee mode is that </font><font color="#00ffff">Potions of Healing</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
</font><font color="#00ffff">Potions of *Healing* </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#00ffff">Potions of Life </font><font color="#ffffff">- key items in both normal and 
coffee-break play - never generate randomly. Instead, the ten random 
Angband level guardians drop set amounts of these potions for you; kill 
all ten (plus Oberon), and you will have 66 Potions of Healing and 7 
Potions of *Healing*, hopefully enough for the end fight. A few 
additional potions can be acquired from quests or the Arena or by 
killing a god.

Instant-coffee mode discourages grindy play; the more monsters you kill 
on a given level, the less accelerated your experience gain is and the 
fewer objects they drop. Monsters directly or indirectly summoned by 
the player drop nothing and give no experience, and any summoned 
monsters give reduced drops and experience once enough monsters have 
been killed on the level. The experience factor scale is flattened 
somewhat for instant-coffee play, making high experience factors less 
punishing.

Instant-coffee mode drops you in the thick of the action extremely 
quickly. It is therefore not recommended for new players - unless you 
wish to be overwhelmed! A complete game in instant-coffee mode 
typically lasts between 2 and 15 hours.
