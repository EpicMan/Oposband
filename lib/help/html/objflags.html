<font color="#00ffff">Equipment Properties

</font><font color="#ffffff">Each object in FrogComposband has certain basic properties: </font><font color="#00ff00">base AC 
</font><font color="#ffffff">(armor class), </font><font color="#00ff00">bonus AC</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#00ff00">damage dice </font><font color="#ffffff">(or a </font><font color="#00ff00">damage multiplier </font><font color="#ffffff">on ranged 
weapons), an accuracy (</font><font color="#00ff00">to-hit</font><font color="#ffffff">) bonus, a damage (</font><font color="#00ff00">to-dam</font><font color="#ffffff">) bonus, and a 
</font><font color="#00ff00">pval </font><font color="#ffffff">indicating the size of various other bonuses. Some or all of these 
attributes can be zero or otherwise irrelevant, and they are usually 
only displayed when they actually matter; for example, damage dice are 
only indicated on melee weapons and on projectiles.

Objects, particularly equipment, may also have additional attributes; 
these are simply present or absent, though their exact effects may 
still depend on additional factors like the item type or the pval. This 
document collectively calls these </font><font color="#ff0000">flag attributes</font><font color="#ffffff">, since the game can 
use simple on-or-off flags to track their presence on the object. There 
are many types of flag attributes - some provide bonuses like extra 
strength or speed, some give abilities like night-vision or telepathy, 
some make you resistant (or vulnerable) to specific types of damage, 
some surround you with elemental auras, some make weapons deadlier 
against specific opponents, and so on - but all of these attributes are 
simply present or absent, practically all are indicated when you 
inspect an *identified* object with the </font><font color="#ff8000">I </font><font color="#ffffff">command, and nearly all are 
indicated in the object's short description through a specific 
</font><font color="#ff0000">abbreviation</font><font color="#ffffff">. (See <a href="objects.html#InscriptionAbbrev"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for a quick list of these abbreviations.)

Finally, pieces of equipment may have </font><font color="#ff0000">curses </font><font color="#ffffff">on them. Curses are 
usually (but not always) removable; and they are usually (but not 
always) separate from flag attributes in that they are not permanent.

This lengthy help file lists and explains most object properties, 
including all publicly indicated flag attributes, though much of the 
information given here can also be found elsewhere in the help.
</font><font color="#00ff00">There is no need to read this document in any detail before starting 
play, or during play; it should be considered reference material, and 
may contain detailed spoilers about items you have yet to see.

<a name="Basic"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Basic Properties

<a name="DamageDice"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Damage Dice </font><font color="#ffffff">- (2d6)

Damage dice indicate the basic damage delivered by an object when you 
hit a monster with them. (Your actual total damage on a hit will also 
depend on many other factors, such as slays, brands, damage bonuses and 
critical hits.)

Damage dice are only displayed on melee weapons and on projectiles; 
they are indicated as (XdY), meaning the game will roll X separate dice 
with Y sides each, and add up the damage. The damage dice of a weapon 
usually depend on the object kind - for example, most short swords are 
(1d8) and most long swords (2d6) - but sometimes you can find a 
</font><font color="#ff0000">dice-boosted </font><font color="#ffffff">weapon (or projectile) with unusually high dice for the 
underlying kind.

<a name="DamageMultiplier"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Damage Multiplier </font><font color="#ffffff">- (x3.50)

Damage multipliers are a property exclusive to ranged weapons. They 
multiple the damage dice and to-dam bonuses of any projectile fired 
with the weapon. Like damage dice, damage multipliers are based on the 
object kind, though they are frequently boosted on artifacts and ego 
items.

<a name="CombatBonuses"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Combat Bonuses </font><font color="#ffffff">- (+6,+9)

Combat bonuses consist of the </font><font color="#00ff00">accuracy bonus </font><font color="#ffffff">(to-hit) and the </font><font color="#00ff00">damage 
bonus </font><font color="#ffffff">(to-dam). On melee weapons, shooters and projectiles these are 
always indicated as (+X,+Y), even when zero; on other items they are 
only indicated when non-zero. Typically, even on non-weapons, both 
values are indicated for clarity if either of them is non-zero; but on 
gloves, boots and body armor it sometimes happens that only one value 
is indicated, as </font><font color="#808080">(-X) </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#c08040">(+Y)</font><font color="#ffffff">. Such a single value can be assumed to be 
an accuracy penalty if negative, and a damage bonus if positive. (The 
display format for a single positive damage bonus is identical to the 
display format for a pval; but combat bonuses are listed before armor 
bonuses while pvals are listed after, and single-value combat display 
only occurs on armor, so the two can always be told apart.)

The applicability of a combat bonus may not always be entirely clear: 
the bonus might apply only to melee, only to archery, to both melee and 
archery, or even apply exclusively to magical combat (in which case it 
boosts spell damage). The bonuses might also not apply to every weapon, 
or could be divided between several weapons in case of dual-wielding.

As a rule, combat bonuses on a melee weapon or ranged weapon only apply 
to the weapon itself; melee bonuses from rings only apply to the weapon 
in the same hand as the ring (two rings can affect a single weapon only 
if that weapon is wielded with both hands); melee bonuses from gloves 
are divided among weapons wielded with the same pair of arms; and other 
melee bonuses are divided among all weapons. On characters with innate 
attacks but no melee weapons, all off-weapon melee bonuses are fully 
applied to the innate attacks.

Melee-themed items like Rings of Combat and Gloves of Slaying 
exclusively boost melee; archery-themed items like Rings of Archery and 
Gloves of the Sniper exclusively boost archery; magic-themed items like 
Rings of Wizardry and Pointy Hats of the Magi exclusively boost spell 
damage (these items always have a to-hit of zero); and most other 
items, including all random artifacts, boost both melee and archery but 
not spell damage. Cloaks of Cowardice and Cloaks of the Bat exclusively 
penalize melee.

<a name="ArmorClass"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Armor Class </font><font color="#ffffff">- [14,+0]

Objects can contribute to the player's armor class (AC) through two 
different numbers: </font><font color="#00ff00">base AC </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#00ff00">bonus AC </font><font color="#ffffff">(to-AC). Armor-type items (body 
armors, shields, cloaks, gloves, helmets and boots) provide both base 
AC and bonus AC, and both are always indicated on these items (even 
when they are zero). Non-armor items never have base AC, but may 
sometimes have bonus AC; as an example, rings of protection frequently 
give a magical AC boost.

Base AC typically depends on the object kind; for example, blue dragon 
scale mail provides 40 base AC while filthy rags provide 1. In rare 
cases, artifacts may have boosted base AC.

Non-magical items usually have a bonus AC of zero, although on specific 
object kinds (such as dragon scale mails) the default bonus AC can also 
be non-zero. The fundamental difference between base AC and bonus AC is 
that base AC is fixed, and cannot ever be improved or damaged; bonus AC 
can be magically enchanted (or improved through smithcraft), but is 
also subject to damage from disenchantment and acid.

Base AC and bonus AC are indicated as [X,+Y] on armor (even if zero), 
and as [+Y] (or [-Y]) on non-armor if other than zero.

<a name="Pval"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Pval </font><font color="#ffffff">- (+3)

All objects have exactly one pval, displayed as (+X) if non-zero. The 
pval determines the size of any additional bonuses (or penalties) on 
the item; for example, an item with +Speed, -Strength and a pval of 3 
will give +3 to speed and -3 to strength.

<a name="Weight"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Weight </font><font color="#ffffff">- 14.0 lbs

The weight of the item, displayed in pounds. Weight can have several 
effects, depending on your character and the type of the item. If the 
total weight of all items carried and equipped is too high, you may 
become </font><font color="#ff0000">overburdened</font><font color="#ffffff">; see <a href="speedsys.html#Burden"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more infomration.

Lighter weapons are easier to wield effectively, easier to dual-wield 
effectively, require less strength and dexterity to maximize your blow 
count with, and are usually helped more by to-dam bonuses (due to the 
higher blow count); but heavier weapons give stronger critical hits, 
can be wielded with two hands if desired, usually have higher dice, and 
are typically helped more by slays and brands (due to the higher dice). 
The game does not inherently favor either light or heavy weapons; both 
are competitive throughout the game, although specific classes may 
strongly prefer one or the other. (Maulers tend to go with the heaviest 
weapon they find, while Duelists prefer something extremely light.)

On melee characters, armor weight is mainly a consideration insofar as 
it contributes to overburdening. Spellcasters may become </font><font color="#ff0000">encumbered </font><font color="#ffffff">if 
the total weight of the armor worn exceeds a specific limit; this will 
proportionally reduce the size of the spellcaster's mana pool. Some 
other classes, like Mystics and Ninjas, also have class-specific total 
armor weight limits; these weight limits are CL-dependent, and 
exceeding them causes class-specific penalties and/or a loss of 
class-specific bonuses.

<a name="Activation"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Activations </font><font color="#ffffff">- {</font><font color="#00ffff">A:Breathe Fire</font><font color="#ffffff">}

Some items have an </font><font color="#ff0000">activation</font><font color="#ffffff">: a special effect you can occasionally 
trigger (with the </font><font color="#ff8000">A </font><font color="#ffffff">command) if you have the item equipped. Activations 
can be either native to the object kind, like breathing fire on a Red 
Dragon Scale Mail, or specific to a given powerful object. Items never 
have more than one activation.

Activations resemble magical devices in that using them requires device 
skill, and powerful activations are likely to fail if your device skill 
is too low. (Due to their abysmal device skill, Berserkers can never 
activate an item.) Activations also have a </font><font color="#ff0000">timeout</font><font color="#ffffff">, indicating how 
frequently they can be triggered; it is as if the activation were a 
device with a single charge, requiring a specific amount of turns to 
pass before it can be used again. Items waiting to regain their 
activation power are marked as {charging}; activation timers only count 
down while the item is equipped, so {charging} items in your inventory 
will remain {charging} indefinitely.

<a name="Flags"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Flag Attributes

</font><font color="#ffffff">Flag attributes are simply present or absent, although their exact 
effects may depend on the object's type and (in the case of bonuses or 
penalties) the size of the pval. Flag attributes are indicated with 
specific abbreviations in the object's description. The applicability 
of combat flag attributes to combat is generally identical to the 
applicability of combat bonuses to combat (see <a href="objflags.html#CombatBonuses"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">above), with the 
exception that off-weapon slays and brands can only be applied to 
innate attacks in special cases.

<a name="Bonuses"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Bonuses and Penalties

</font><font color="#ffffff">Bonuses and maluses form the first and second groups in a list of flag 
abbreviations (such as </font><font color="#808080">{</font><font color="#00ff00">InWiCh</font><font color="#808080">;</font><font color="#c00000">-StDxCn</font><font color="#808080">;AcElFiCoPoLiDkCfNtNxCa;AgTy}</font><font color="#ffffff">). 
The size of the bonus or penalty is determined by the object's pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Attack Speed </font><font color="#ffffff">- {At}, {-At}

The bonus gives 0.50 extra blows per unit of pval, divided between all 
applicable weapons. The penalty deducts 1.00 blows from all applicable 
weapons per unit of pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Speed </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Sp}, {-Sp}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Strength </font><font color="#ffffff">- {St}, {-St}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Intelligence </font><font color="#ffffff">- {In}, {-In}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Wisdom </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Wi}, {-Wi}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Dexterity </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Dx}, {-Dx}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Constitution </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Cn}, {-Cn}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Charisma </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ch}, {-Ch}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Stealth </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Sl}, {-Sl}

These bonuses and maluses simply increase or decrease the appropriate 
statistic by the pval amount.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Magic Mastery </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Md}, {-Md}

Increases or decreases device skill by 8 per unit of pval. The penalty 
version automatically triggers a penalty to device power as well.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Searching </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Sr}

Increases Searching skill and Perception skill by 5 per unit of pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Infravision </font><font color="#ffffff">- {If}

Increases infravision range by 1 square per unit of pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Digging </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Dg}

Increases digging ability by 20 per unit of pval (comparable to the 
bonus from digging with an implement 20 pounds heavier).

</font><font color="#ff8000">Life </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Lf}, {-Lf}

Increases or decreases your constitution-based life multiplier by 3 
percentage points per unit of pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Device Power </font><font color="#ffffff">- {+10%}, {-10%}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Spell Power </font><font color="#ffffff">- &lt;+23%&gt;, &lt;-23%&gt;
</font><font color="#ff8000">Spell Capacity </font><font color="#ffffff">- [+15%], [-15%]

These three bonuses (and their corresponding penalty forms) are special 
cases, in that they are listed in object descriptions with the basic 
properties and not with other flag attributes. This is because the size 
of the bonus is somewhat unusual, and would otherwise be highly unclear 
without </font><font color="#ff8000">I</font><font color="#ffffff">nspection: 5 percentage points per unit of pval for device 
power and spell capacity, and 100/13 (approximately 7.69) percentage 
points per unit of pval for spell power.

Spell power and spell capacity (max-SP modifier) can appear as either 
bonuses or penalties. Device power by itself only appears as a bonus; 
but -Md (the device skill penalty) also contributes negative device 
power, and is effectively the penalty version of both +DeviceSkill and 
+DevicePower.

<a name="Resistances"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Resistances, Immunities and Vulnerabilities

</font><font color="#ffffff">Immunities, vulnerabilities and resistances each form an abbreviation 
group. Resistances mitigate both the damage and the side-effects of the 
corresponding damage types, or elements; multiple sources of the same 
resistance stack in a specific, non-linear way. A vulnerability cancels 
out one source of resistance, or provides a corresponding damage 
increase if there are no resistances to cancel out. Immunities fully 
eliminate all damage and side effects from the corresponding element.

See <a href="defend.html#ResistingMagic"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details on how resistances work, and <a href="defend.html#Resistances"></font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for comments 
about the effects and relative importance of individual resistances.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Acid </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ac}, {*Ac}, {-Ac}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Electricity </font><font color="#ffffff">- {El}, {*El}, {-El}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Fire </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Fi}, {*Fi}, {-Fi}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Cold </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Co}, {*Co}, {-Co}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Poison </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Po}, {-Po}

These five resistances are collectively known as the </font><font color="#ff0000">low resistances </font><font color="#ffffff">or 
</font><font color="#ff0000">base resistances</font><font color="#ffffff">; the latter term is more usually applied to the four 
most common resistances only, excluding poison. Low resistances all 
follow the same damage reduction curve: 50% with one source of 
resistance, 65% with two, 72% with three, 75% with four (and so on). 
Side-effect calculations compare the resistance level to a 66-sided die 
for item destruction, and a 55-sided die for other side effects. The 
low resistances, and the four base resistances in particular, are the 
most important resistances in the early game.

While all resistances except time have a corresponding vulnerability 
flag, the four base resistances are the only ones with a corresponding 
immunity flag. It is possible to acquire other immunities, but only 
through the character's race or class.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Light </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Li}, {-Li}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Dark </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Dk}, {-Dk}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Confusion </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Cf}, {-Cf}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Nether </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Nt}, {-Nt}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Nexus </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Nx}, {-Nx}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sound </font><font color="#ffffff">- {So}, {-So}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Shards </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Sh}, {-Sh}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Chaos </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ca}, {-Ca}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Disenchantment </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Di}, {-Di}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Time </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ti}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Blindness </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Bl}, {-Bl}

These are the </font><font color="#ff0000">high resistances</font><font color="#ffffff">; they are grouped together with the low 
resistances in object descriptions, but work in a somewhat different 
way. High resistances reduce damage by 30% with one source item, 40% 
with two, 45% with three, 47% with four etc.; side effects compare the 
resistance level to a 41-sided die for item destruction, a 31-sided die 
for item disenchantment and a 33-sided die for other effects.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Fear </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Fe}, {-Fe}

While grouped with the other resistances, fear resistance is a special 
case and works in a very different way. See <a href="status.html#Fear"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details on 
fear and how to resist it.

<a name="Abilities"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Miscellaneous Abilities

</font><font color="#ffffff">This flag group contains a variety of miscellaneous abilities, most 
(but not all) of them positive. Several of the attributes in this group 
- Extra Might, Extra Shots and Weaponmastery - are functionally 
pval-dependent bonuses, but are traditionally abbreviated with the 
ability group.

For attributes said to have a 1-in-X chance of triggering a specific 
effect each turn, "turn" is used as shorthand for a unit of 10 game 
turns. (See <a href="speedsys.html#Timers"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for a detailed technical explanation.)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Easy Spellcasting </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Es}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Decreased Mana Costs </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Dm}

These attributes affect your spellcasting efficiency. Easy Spellcasting 
reduces spell failure rates by 4 percentage points, with an additional 
1-point reduction for non-book spells and Rage techniques which ignores 
minimum failrates; the Easy Spell reductions are cumulative with the 
realm-specific bonuses from realm lights. Decreased Mana Costs reduces 
spell mana costs to 75% of the original cost; this reduction does not 
stack with the bonuses from a realm light. Having more than one source 
of Es or Dm does not provide any additional benefits.

The Es and Dm flags are special in that not all characters receive the 
same benefits from them; some receive no benefits at all, and some 
receive the benefits from specific items only. Accordingly, the Es and 
Dm flags are </font><font color="#00ff00">displayed to the player only when relevant</font><font color="#ffffff">, and otherwise 
hidden (even on </font><font color="#ff8000">I</font><font color="#ffffff">nspection); if you see a Ring of Wizardry with a high 
item score but seemingly no special attributes on it, it probably has 
either hidden Es or hidden Dm or both.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Throwing </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Th}

Marks a weapon as suitable for throwing. This attribute increases a 
throw's damage multiplier by 1 and also increases the maximum range for 
throwing the object. Ninjas and Ninja-Lawyers receive special bonuses 
for throwing swords with the Throwing flag.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Reflection </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Rf}

Gives the player a 75% chance of reflecting an incoming bolt spell. 
Multiple sources of Reflection do not stack. See <a href="faq.html#Reflection"></font><font color="#00ff00">[h]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for details.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Free Action </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Fa}

Provides free action. One level of Free Action gives you a saving throw 
against paralysis (which also speeds up recovery if you do get 
paralyzed); two levels of Free Action give you complete paralysis 
protection against monsters of level 41 and below, and two saving 
throws against high-level monsters; three levels of Free Action make 
you immune to paralysis, except in the special case of the Ancient Foul 
Curse. Free Action also protects you from slowing spells, and mitigates 
the side effects of inertia.

</font><font color="#ff8000">See Invisible </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Si}

Each source of See Invisible gives you one additional chance to spot a 
given invisible monster. Searching skill improves the success rate of 
See Invisible rolls; even multiple sources of See Invisible will be 
highly unreliable if your Searching skill is poor.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Hold Life </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Hl}

Each source of Hold Life gives you one additional roll against 
experience drain and one additional roll against unlife attacks. 
(Charisma improves the success rate of unlife saves; experience-drain 
saves have a fixed probability, depending only on the strength of the 
attack.) In the case that all XP-drain saves fail, the amount of XP 
lost is still radically reduced for characters with at least one source 
of Hold Life.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Slow Digestion </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Sd}

Slow Digestion halves your digestion rate and protects you from the 
side-effects of the Nausea mutation. Multiple sources of Slow Digestion 
do not stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Regeneration </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Rg}

Regeneration increases your base regeneration rate by 100 percentage 
points, thereby speeding up your HP regeneration, SP regeneration and 
digestion. Multiple sources of Regeneration will stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Mana Recovery </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Rm}

Mana Recovery doubles your SP regeneration rate (after accounting for 
all other regeneration bonuses and penalties). Multiple sources of Mana 
Recovery will not stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Levitation </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Lv}

Allows you to fly over dark pits and mountainous wilderness, prevents 
overburdened characters from drowning in deep water, reduces damage 
from standing in (or over) lava or toxic waste, reduces damage from 
Gravity and Air attacks, mitigates the side effects of Gravity and 
Storm Winds, eliminates movement speed penalties in wooded or snowy 
areas, and protects you from some types of floor traps (unless you go 
out of your way to trigger them). Multiple sources of Levitation do not 
stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Night Vision </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Nv}

Allows you to see your surroundings without requiring illumination.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Permanent Light </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Lu}

Increases your light radius by 1. Multiple sources of permanent light 
will stack. Weapons with this attribute deal extra damage when used 
against monsters vulnerable to light.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Warning </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Wr}

The item warns you when you are about to step into a trap, and glows 
with a specific warning color if a new unique is generated on the 
level. The color of the glow depends on the unique's native depth 
compared to the player's level, ranging from black for the most 
dangerous uniques to purple, deep red, red, pink and white.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Extra Might </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Xm}

Increases your shooter's damage multiplier by 0.20*(reciprocal of the 
shooter kind's native shots per turn)*pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Extra Shots </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Xs}

Improves your shooting speed by (0.15 shots/turn)*(shooter kind's 
native shots/turn)*pval.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Random Teleportation </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Te}

On cursed items, gives a 1-in-200 chance each turn of triggering an 
uncontrollable random teleport. On other items, gives a 1-in-200 chance 
each turn of prompting for a random teleport, and lets you attempt to 
follow nearby monsters when they teleport away. Adding the </font><font color="#ff8000">. </font><font color="#ffffff">character 
to the item's inscription will automatically dismiss all prompts for a 
random teleport.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Aggravation </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ag}

Wakes up and offends all nearby monsters. This attribute can also 
appear as a removable curse, in which case it has no abbreviation and 
is only indicated on inspection.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Blessed </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Bs}

Blessed items are somewhat resistant to being cursed. (They do not help 
you resist cursing otherwise; the protection applies only to the item 
itself.) Good-aligned Priests can use swords and polearms without 
penalties only if the weapon is blessed.

</font><font color="#ff8000">*Ancient Foul Curse* </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ty}

Gives a 1-in-200 chance each turn of triggering the Ancient Foul Curse. 
This attribute can also appear as a removable curse, in which case it 
has no abbreviation and is only indicated on inspection.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Permanent Darkness </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Ds}

Decreases your light radius by 1 on most items, by 2 on lanterns and by 
3 on advanced lamps. Multiple sources of permanent darkness will stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Weaponmastery (Extra Dice) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Wm}

Gives 1 extra damage die per unit of pval, divided between applicable 
weapons. Since Weaponmastery increases the number of dice (the </font><font color="#00ffff">X </font><font color="#ffffff">in the 
</font><font color="#00ffff">(XdY)</font><font color="#ffffff">), it is strongest when applied to weapons with many damage sides 
(a high </font><font color="#00ffff">Y</font><font color="#ffffff">); slays, brands and sharpness (especially *sharpness*) also 
work together well with Weaponmastery.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Auto-Identify </font><font color="#ffffff">- {Id}

Automatically identifies all items you walk over, as well as all 
inventory items and equipment.

<a name="Auras"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Auras and Shells

</font><font color="#ffffff">This abbreviation group contains elemental auras, protective magical 
sheaths, and attributes which interfere with the normal actions of the 
player or monsters.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Aura of Fire </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[F}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Aura of Electricity </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[E}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Aura of Cold </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[C}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Aura of Shards </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[Sh}

The four elemental auras all work in the same way: each time a monster 
hits you in melee, they will take some elemental damage from the aura. 
The strength of the aura depends on the player's level and the number 
of aura sources; multiple sources of the same aura partially stack, 
each source adding 2 damage dice to the original aura.

Being surrounded by an aura of fire additionally increases your light 
radius by 1 if it would otherwise be 0 or lower. This can sometimes 
make fire auras inconvenient for Ninjas and Ninja-Lawyers.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Aura of Retaliation/Revenge </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[At}

With this aura, each a time monster hits you in melee, you retaliate by 
hitting them back. This aura is extremely powerful on characters with 
low blow counts but high damage per hit, such as duelists.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Anti-Magic Shell </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[M}

Gives an extremely high saving throw, but also prevents you from 
casting spells with the </font><font color="#ff8000">m </font><font color="#ffffff">command. (Some classes who use the </font><font color="#ff8000">m </font><font color="#ffffff">command 
for class-specific techniques other than spells are still allowed to 
use them; these include berserkers, blood-knights, weaponmasters, 
maulers, alchemists, rage-mages, mimics and possessors, but not ninjas 
or samurai.)

Anti-magic is </font><font color="#ff0000">not </font><font color="#ffffff">a saving throw bonus; it simply guarantees a very 
high saving throw, regardless of how good or bad your saving throw 
would otherwise be. (The quality of your saving throw will be somewhat 
level-dependent, but even at low CL you can reliably shrug off nearly 
all curses.)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Anti-Teleportation Shell </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[T}

Prevents you from teleporting or being teleported by magical means. 
(Non-magical teleportation may still occur in some rare cases.) On most 
characters this attribute is very undesirable, since teleportation is 
often your best escape from a dangerous situation; berserkers may 
sometimes accept it, but even for them it is at best a mixed blessing.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Anti-Summoning Shell </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[Sm}

One of the rarest and most valuable object attributes, the 
anti-summoning shell blocks two-thirds of all summons. (This includes 
your own summons, so summon-based characters like Quylthulgs may not 
consider it exclusively good.)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Magic Resistance </font><font color="#ffffff">- {[Mr}

Reduces the damage from all non-innate monster spells by 5 percentage 
points per unit of pval. Innate pseudo-spells like breaths, rockets or 
boulders are not affected.

<a name="Slays"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Slays and Brands

</font><font color="#ffffff">Brands, slays and *slays* increase an attack's damage against specific 
monsters. (As a rule, brands are elemental and increase your damage 
against monsters who do not resist that element, while slays increase 
your damage against specific monster categories like animals or orcs; a 
*slay* [or kill attribute] is simply a more powerful slay.) Melee slays 
and brands work by multiplying a weapon's dice roll; archery slays and 
brands work by multiplying both the dice roll of the projectile and the 
damage bonus of the projectile. For this reason, archery slays have 
lower multipliers than melee slays.

Slays and brands generally do not stack; if multiple slays or brands 
could apply to a single attack, only the strongest slay or brand is 
applied. The only exceptions to this are the Mark of Chaos, which 
partially combines with other slays; Force Brand, which fully combines 
with other slays; and class-specific brands like the Samurai brands 
(which never generate as object flags). The Permanent Light weapon 
attribute (Lu) acts like a weak brand against monsters hurt by weak 
light, and can also stack somewhat with normal brands.

Several pseudo-brands with effects other than multiplying the dice are 
grouped together with the "true" brands; these generally do not affect 
damage at all, but stack fully with slays and brands (and each other) 
in the sense that they can apply to the same attack.

Brands, *slays* and slays each form an abbreviation group. See <a href="attack.html#Slays"></font><font color="#00ff00">[i]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for 
a more detailed overview of how slays and brands work.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Acid Brand </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|A}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Lightning Brand </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|E}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Flame Tongue (Fire Brand) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|F}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Cold Brand </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|Co}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Viper's Fang (Poison Brand) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|P}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Shadow Sweep (Darkness Brand) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|Dk}

The six elemental brands proper all have mid-tier dice multipliers: 
x1.62 for archery, x2.40 for normal melee, and x3.20 when augmented by 
the Mark of Chaos rolling the same brand.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Mark of Chaos </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|Ca}

The Mark of Chaos is a special brand; on each hit, it will randomly 
present itself as one of five common brands or one of ten common slays. 
If the brand or slay rolled was one the weapon did not already have, 
the weapon will simply act as if it did have that brand; if the brand 
was already present, it is made stronger by the Mark of Chaos.

In addition to the random brand or slay (which is always rolled), the 
Mark of Chaos has a 3 in 35 chance of making the hit vampiric and a 2 
in 175 chance of applying the Touch of Confusion.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Vampiric Weapon </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|V}

Vampirism is a special brand; it has no effect on the dice roll, but 
instead drains life from the monster attacked (reducing its maximum HP 
by one-eighth of the damage dealt) and heals the player by 2d(dam/6) 
hit points. (If the player's life points were reduced, vampirism will 
heal life points instead.) Vampiric healing is limited to 50 HP per 
round of attacks against a monster on most characters, and to 100 HP 
per round of attacks against a monster on Monster-mode vampires. 
Vampiric healing is multiplied by the mutation HP regeneration 
modifier.

Vampirism only works against living monsters; it has no effect on 
demons, undead or the nonliving.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Earthquakes (Impact Weapon) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|Q}

The impact brand is a special brand; it has no effect on the dice roll, 
but instead has a chance to stun and cause earthquakes on successful 
hits. The stunning and earthquakes will always occur if the damage roll 
exceeds 50 after multipliers; otherwise, stunning will not occur and 
earthquakes have a 1 in 7 chance of occurring.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Stunning </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|St}

Stunning is a special brand; it has no effect on the dice roll, but 
instead stuns monsters on successful hits.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Sharpness (Vorpal) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|S}
</font><font color="#ff8000">*Sharpness* (*Vorpal*) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|SS}

Sharpness and *Sharpness* are special brands; they do not represent a 
dice multiplier per se, but occasionally trigger special vorpal 
critical hits (see <a href="attack.html#Sharpness"></font><font color="#00ff00">[j]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">) which do multiply the dice. Vorpal criticals 
are highly random in the short run, but in the long run Sharpness 
averages as a 11/9 (x1.22) dice multiplier and *Sharpness* averages as 
a 5/3 (x1.67) dice multiplier. While these multipliers are fairly 
modest, they fully stack with all other dice multipliers (and with dice 
boosters like Weaponmastery); this potentially makes them highly 
valuable on weapons with high dice, especially if normal slays or 
brands also apply.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Force Brand (Mana Brand) </font><font color="#ffffff">- {|M}

Mana Brand is a special brand; it combines with all other slays and 
brands, increasing the dice multiplier by 50% and then adding another 
140 percentage points. (This effectively makes it a x2.9 multiplier 
when it exists in isolation.) The mana brand is highly powerful but 
consumes mana rapidly, and only functions while the player still has 
mana; if the player has no mana or runs out of mana, the mana brand 
becomes useless.

</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Evil </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/X*}, {/*}
</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Good </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/XA}, {/A}
</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Living </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/XLv}, {/Lv}

Low-tier slays, making a weapon or projectile especially deadly against 
the specified group (evil monsters, good monsters or living monsters). 
Slay multipliers of x1.43 for archery, x1.90 for melee and x2.53 when 
strengthened by Mark of Chaos; kill multipliers of x1.86 for archery, 
x3.20 for melee and x4.00 when strengthened by Mark of Chaos. Note that 
living monsters do not have any specific "living" flag; a living 
monster is simply any monster who is not nonliving, a demon or an 
undead.

</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Humans </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/Xp}, {/p}
</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Animals </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/XZ}, {/Z}

Mid-tier slays, making a weapon or projectile especially deadly against 
the specified group (humans or natural creatures). Slay multipliers of 
x1.62 for archery, x2.40 for melee and x3.20 when strengthened by Mark 
of Chaos; kill multipliers of x2.34 for archery, x3.70 for melee and 
x4.62 when strengthened by Mark of Chaos.

</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Dragons </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/XD}, {/D}

</font><font color="#ff8000">*Slay*/Slay Undead </font><font color="#ffffff">- {/XL}, {/L}

High-tier slays, making a weapon or projectile especially deadly 
against the specified group. Slay multipliers of x1.90 for archery, 
x2.80 for melee and x3.73 when strengthened by Mark of Chaos; kill 
multipliers of x2.80 for archery, x4.50 for melee and x5.62 when 
strengthened by Mark of Chaos.

<a name="Telepathy"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Telepathies

</font><font color="#ffffff">Various forms of extra-sensory perception are categorized into two 
abbreviation groups; one for broad telepathy, one for limited types.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Telepathy </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Tele}

"Full" telepathy. Unlike other forms of telepathy, it only detects 
monsters with minds; it always detects monsters with "normal" minds, 
occasionally detects monsters with "weird" minds (including most ants, 
worms and spiders), and does not detect monsters with no/empty minds 
(including most molds, jellies, golems and vortices).

</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Evil </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Evil}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Good </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Good}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Nonliving </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Nolv}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Uniques </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Uniq}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Living </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Lvng}

Wide telepathies, detecting all monsters in the specified group 
(regardless of whether they have weird or empty minds). "Living" 
monsters are any monsters who are not demons, undead or nonliving.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Humans </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~p}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Dragons </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~D}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Orcs </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~o}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Trolls </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~T}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Giants </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~P}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Demons </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~U}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Undead </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~L}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sense Animals/Natural Creatures </font><font color="#ffffff">- {~Z}

Limited telepathies, detecting all monsters in the specified group. 
There is no fundamental difference between this group and the wide 
telepathies; the distinction is entirely arbitrary, based mostly on 
abbreviation simplicity.

<a name="Sustains"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Sustains

</font><font color="#ffffff">The six stat sustains form the final group of abbreviation flags.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Sustain Strength </font><font color="#ffffff">- {(St}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sustain Intelligence </font><font color="#ffffff">- {(In}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sustain Wisdom </font><font color="#ffffff">- {(Wi}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sustain Dexterity </font><font color="#ffffff">- {(Dx}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sustain Constitution </font><font color="#ffffff">- {(Cn}
</font><font color="#ff8000">Sustain Charisma </font><font color="#ffffff">- {(Ch}

These attributes protect the relevant stat from most types of temporary 
drain and make the stat somewhat resistant to being scrambled. Sustains 
do not prevent temporary loss of stats to time attacks, and generally 
do not protect against permanent stat drain (from patron punishments, 
potions of ruination, disease attacks or other sources).

<a name="Inspection"></a></font><font color="#c08040">Attributes Visible on Inspection

</font><font color="#ffffff">These flag attributes have no corresponding abbreviation, but are 
indicated on </font><font color="#ff8000">I</font><font color="#ffffff">nspection if known.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Ignores Acid (Rustproof)
Ignores Electricity
Ignores Fire
Ignores Cold

</font><font color="#ffffff">The four elemental ignore flags protect the object itself from being 
harmed by that element. Ignoring acid is particularly useful on armor, 
since it prevents loss of AC to acidic corrosion.

Items with all four ignore flags are described as "cannot be harmed by 
the elements". While such items technically only resist the four base 
elements, they are generally safe from all harm in your inventory. (The 
distinction becomes relevant if the object is on the floor, in which 
case it may be destroyed by higher elements if it isn't an artifact.)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Unenchantable

</font><font color="#ffffff">Unenchantable items cannot be enchanted, turned into artifacts or ego 
items, or otherwise improved by any magical or non-magical means.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Suitable for Riding

</font><font color="#ffffff">Weapons with this attribute can be used while mounted without incurring 
accuracy penalties. Cavalry and Skillmasters receive special combat 
bonuses for using Riding weapons while riding.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Dual Wielding (Genji)

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a bonus equivalent to 23 percentage points of dual-wielding 
proficiency, and somewhat reduces dual-wielding penalties on heavy 
weapons. Additionally, damage bonuses from high Strength (which are 
normally reduced on dual-wielded weapons unless the character is a 
Berserker or has completely mastered dual-wielding) are allowed to 
apply as usual.

The Genji bonuses stack with dual-wielding proficiency and with the 
Easy Dual-Wielding bonus on Mariliths and Dagger-speciality 
Weaponmasters. They do not stack with the Ambidexterity demigod talent, 
which becomes useless with Genji. On characters with multiple sets of 
arms, only one pair of weapons will receive the Genji benefits.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Drains Experience

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-4 chance every turn of permanently draining a small amount 
of experience. Although the amount of experience drained is somewhat 
CL-dependent, the penalty is more noticeable at low CLs, when 
experience gain is slower and the drain represents a higher percentage 
of total XP. This attribute can also appear as a removable curse.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Negates Invulnerability

</font><font color="#ffffff">Renders worthless all invulnerability spheres, including your own.

<a name="Curses"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Equipment Curses

</font><font color="#ffffff">Curses are usually removable object attributes with negative effects. 
Some curses (like the Ancient Foul Curse) can occasionally appear as 
normal, unremovable flag attributes; the Permanent Curse is also 
unremovable, even though it is not a normal flag attribute.

Items with removable curses are invariably </font><font color="#ff0000">sticky</font><font color="#ffffff">, meaning they cannot 
be removed without uncursing the item first. (Berserkers and 
bear-shaped Beornings are an exception to this; they can uncurse Cursed 
and Heavily Cursed items simply by taking them off. Mummies can also 
unequip most cursed items at will, without uncursing them.) If you 
equip a sticky item, a curse indicator (</font><font color="#404040">Cursed</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#404040">CURSED </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#404040">*CURSED*</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
depending on the strength of the strongest sticky curse on any item 
equipped) will appear in the main sidebar.

Items with unremovable curses (other than the Permanent Curse) are not 
necessarily sticky, although they usually at least start out with a 
sticky curse.

As a rule, multiple instances of the same curse do not stack; two items 
with the Ancient Foul Curse are not any worse than one. The only 
exceptions to this are the Low AC curse and the Extra Spell Fails 
curse, which have cumulative effects.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Cursed
Heavily Cursed
Permanently Cursed

</font><font color="#ffffff">The simplest curses; these curses simply make the item sticky. At least 
one of these curses is always present on any item with another 
removable curse on it, but they can also exist on otherwise curse-free 
items. A Cursed item can be uncursed with Remove Curse; a Heavily 
Cursed item can only be uncursed with *Remove Curse*; a Permanent Curse 
cannot be uncursed, although other temporary curses on the permanently 
cursed item can still be removed with *Remove Curse*. (A permanent 
curse is technically removable by mundanizing the item, although 
Berserkers have no way of accomplishing this.)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Adds Weak Curses

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-2000 chance per turn of adding new weak curses to the 
item.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Attracts Animals

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-2500 chance per turn of summoning hostile animals.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Catlike Tread

</font><font color="#ffffff">Reduces your stealth by 4. (Cats may move quietly in theory, but 
orchestral accompaniment will give them away!)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Cowardice

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-1500 chance per turn of making you scared.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Dispels Magic

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-128 chance per turn of attempting to dispel random buffs 
1d20 times.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Drains HP

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-666 chance per turn of draining 2*CL hit points, 
potentially killing you outright if your hit points are very low.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Drains Mana

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-666 chance per turn of draining CL spell points.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Drains Devices

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-333 chance per turn of attempting to drain charges from a 
random device in your inventory. (Carrying multiple devices does not 
increase the probability of the curse processing, but does increase the 
probability that it successfully locates a device to drain.)

</font><font color="#ff8000">Extra Device Fails

</font><font color="#ffffff">Decreases your device skill by 10 points (-1.25 Md) if the item is 
heavily or permanently cursed, and by 5 points if the item is lightly 
cursed. Only the strongest instance of this curse applies.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Extra Spell Fails

</font><font color="#ffffff">Increases your spell fail rates by 3 points if the item is lightly 
cursed, and 10 points if the item is heavily or permanently cursed. 
Multiple instances of this curse on separate items will stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Fast Digestion

</font><font color="#ffffff">Increases your digestion rate by an amount equivalent to a 
300-percentage-point regeneration bonus.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Irritates Airways

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-888 chance per turn of making you unwell. This curse has 
no effect on characters of nonliving races.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Low AC

</font><font color="#ffffff">Reduces your AC by 10 if the item is lightly cursed, and by 30 if it's 
heavily or permanently cursed. This curse only generates on armor. 
Multiple instances of this curse on separate items will stack.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Miss Blows

</font><font color="#ffffff">Reduces the weapon's to-hit by 5 if the item is lightly cursed, and by 
15 if it's heavily or permanently cursed. This curse only generates on 
weapons, and the penalty is not applied to any other weapons used.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Open Wounds

</font><font color="#ffffff">Reduces your wound recovery rate to one-third of what it would 
otherwise be.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Slow Regeneration

</font><font color="#ffffff">Slashes your regeneration rate to one-fifth of what it would otherwise 
be.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Adds Heavy Curses

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-2000 chance per turn of adding new heavy curses to the 
item. This curse only generates on heavily cursed items.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Aggravates

</font><font color="#ffffff">Awakens and offends all nearby monsters. This curse only generates on 
heavily cursed items, though it may also appear as a normal unremovable 
flag attribute.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Attracts Demons

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-1111 chance per turn of summoning hostile demons. This 
curse only generates on heavily cursed items.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Attracts Dragons

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-800 chance per turn of summoning hostile dragons. This 
curse only generates on heavily cursed items.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Drains Experience

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-4 chance per turn of permanently draining a small amount 
of experience. Although the amount of experience drained is somewhat 
CL-dependent, the penalty is more noticeable at low CLs, when 
experience gain is slower and the drain represents a higher percentage 
of total XP. This curse only generates on heavily cursed items, though 
it may also appear as a normal unremovable flag attribute.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Induces Harmful Mutations

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-1500 chance per turn of giving you a harmful mutation 
(randomly pulled from the list of all mutations whose likelihood is 
increased on Unlucky characters and decreased on Lucky characters). 
This curse only generates on heavily cursed items.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Invites Danger

</font><font color="#ffffff">Increases the monster generation level for summoned hostile monsters by 
4 or (DL+15)/10, whichever is higher; also increases the likelihood of 
hostile summons generating out-of-depth. This curse only generates on 
heavily cursed items.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Random Teleportation

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-200 chance per turn of triggering an uncontrollable random 
teleport. This curse only generates on heavily cursed items; it can 
also appear as a normal unremovable flag, in which case it functions 
somewhat differently and isn't necessarily a negative attribute.

</font><font color="#ff8000">Baby Foul Curse

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-200 chance per turn of triggering the Baby Foul Curse. 
This curse only generates on heavily cursed items.

</font><font color="#ff8000">*Ancient Foul Curse*

</font><font color="#ffffff">Gives a 1-in-200 chance per turn of triggering the Ancient Foul Curse. 
This curse only generates on heavily cursed items, though it may also 
appear as a normal unremovable flag attribute.
