-Forked from FrogComposband 7.1.Chocolate
-Changed variant name to Oposband and version to 0.1.0
-Removed many unnessary if_savefile_older_than calls as we won't be converting those
-Removed 18/* notation for stats. Old 18/10 is now just 19, 18/100 is 28, 18/*** is 40, etc
-Adjust many Charisma values to pre-PosChengband values
-Fear saves now work off of best of Strength and Charisma, to make strong but poor CHR monsters like zombies and balrogs better at fear.
-Identify acts as *Identify* and the latter is being phased out
-Psuedo-ID items on walkover, and Average/Good items IDed on walkover.
-Sorceror reverted to using INT for casting. CHR was thrown in because DND sorceror's are CHR-casters, but they are a completely different creature from the Zangband sorceror, who is just an uber-mage. Sorceror INT now +6 and CHR now -2
-Added Hexblade and Chaos Mage from Composbad
-Removed Chaotic personality, chaos patrons are reserved for the two chaos classes.
-Many monsters are more affected by doors than before: felines, dragon flies, canines, snakes, and ants
-Reversed pack AI settings for animals and sentient beings, so the latter will try to lure healthy players into rooms while the latter will hunt you down. Idea from Sil
-Player now receives full HP and SP restore when levelling up

TODO
-Add Blue Mage from Hengband, but add in the Imitator's ability to do observed things for the past 3 observed monster spells.
-Add elemental lord from Portralis
-Merge Weaponmaster's ranged weapon specialties into Archer class, and melee/shield specialties into Warrior.
-Add or merge vanilla's new necromancer into poschangeband necromancer.
-Add Vanilla's new Druid and shapeshifting class?
-Change stealth mechanic to affect monster awareness of the player. So high stealth players would appear and disappear to monsters, making taking on a group more manageable as more distant ones are less likely to be able to see you to engage.
-Should speed just be move speed?s
